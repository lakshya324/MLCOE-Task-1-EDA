## Introduction

This notebook is part of the MLCOE training and covers Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using a dataset from MovieLens. The main goal is to analyze and visualize the distribution of ratings for movies and gain insights from the data.

## What is EDA?

**Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.

## Installing Libraries

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed by running the provided code block to import NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Importing DataSet

The notebook imports the MovieLens dataset, and you can find the dataset link [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). The dataset is loaded using Pandas and initial exploratory analysis is performed.

## Data Preprocessing

The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing steps, converting the data into a matrix form where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and entries represent user ratings.

## Finding Movie 1 Analysis

An analysis of the distribution of ratings for Movie 1 (Toy Story 1995) is presented, along with insights into the overall distribution of ratings for all movies.

## Best Regards

The notebook concludes with a signature and timestamp.
